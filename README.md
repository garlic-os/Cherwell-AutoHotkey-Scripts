# Cherwell AutoHotkey Scripts
AutoHotkey scripts to improve your quality of life using Cherwell.

You can guess what most of these scripts do by their name, but `Hotstrings.ahk` adds a lot of shortcuts. [Take a look inside of it](https://github.com/the-garlic-os/Cherwell-AutoHotkey-Scripts/blob/main/Hotstrings.ahk) to see what hotstrings you can type (don't worry, it's mostly just English!). You must start each hotstring with "@#". Typing "@#mfa" will replace it with its respective body of text, but just typing "mfa" will leave the string as is.
