# Cherwell AutoHotkey Scripts
AutoHotkey scripts to improve your quality of life using Cherwell.

***These scripts require AutoHotkey!***  
Download AutoHotkey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/  
Once you have AutoHotkey, set the AHK files to open with `AutoHotkeyU64.exe`.

(Pro tip: you can open the installer EXE with 7-Zip and extract the program without installing it if you don't want to install or don't have Administrator rights.)

You can guess what most of these scripts do by their name, but `Hotstrings.ahk` adds a lot of shortcuts. Take a look inside of it to see what hotstrings you can type (don't worry, it's mostly just English!). You must start each hotstring with "@#". Typing "@#mfa" will replace it with its respective body of text, but just typing "mfa" will leave the string as is.
